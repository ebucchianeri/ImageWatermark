TO SEE PLOTS:
gnuplot:

load "plot_TC.plt"
load "plot_speedup.plt"
load "plot_scalab.plt"
load "plot_efficiency.plt"


-------------------------------------------
HOW PLOTS HAVE BEEN BUILT

From the output of trials with 500 images we get 2 files of completion times plus the file with the times from the model: 
      completion_time_THR_500.txt
      completion_time_THRNORR_500.txt
      completion_time_FF_500.txt
      completion_time_MODEL_500.txt


In order to generate files containing speedup, scalability and efficiency used by the 3 gnuplot script:


Speedup files:

   awk '{print $1, Tc_sequenziale/$2}' completion_time_(FF|THR|THRNORR|MODEL)_500.txt > speedup_(FF|THR|THRNORR|MODEL)_500.txt


Efficiency files:
     
   awk '{print $1, $2/$1}' speedup_(FF|THR|THRNORR|MODEL)_500.txt > efficiency_(FF|THR|THRNORR|MODEL)_500.txt   


Scalability files:
     
   awk '{print $1, Tpar[1]/$2}' completion_time_(FF|THR|THRNORR|MODEL)_500.txt > scalab_(FF|THR|THRNORR|MODEL)_500.txt
